# RL-LiquidHandler
Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Liquid Handler Planning

This repository provides three model for automated protocol design for robotic liquid handlers. 
Pleaes refer to the paper for the details of each model. 

For the reinforcement model, we used CORA (Continual Reinforcement Learning Agents) for the experimental setup. 
This repository is adopted from [**CORA repository**](https://github.com/AGI-Labs/continual_rl). We created the
liquid handler as a new environment and designed a new network architecture suitable for the environment. Please refer to CORA repository for installation instructions.
